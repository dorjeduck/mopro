# progressbar.ðŸ”¥

A lightweight and customizable progress bar for Mojo, ideal for tracking the progress of long-running operations in loops.

## Usage

In its simplest usage, you specify the total number of iterations and provide a callback function that will be called for each iteration:

```python
from time import sleep
from mopro import progress_bar

fn main():
    fn one_step(i: Int):
        sleep(0.01)
        # your operations here

    progress_bar(
        total=256,
        callback=one_step
    )
```

### Customizations

```pythonâ€“
from time import sleep
from mopro import progress_bar

fn main():
    fn one_step(i: Int):
        sleep(0.01)
        
    progress_bar(
        total=256,
        callback=one_step, 
        prefix="Epoch:", 
        bar_size=20,
        bar_fill = "ðŸ”¥",
        bar_empty = "  "
    )
```
