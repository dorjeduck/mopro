# progressbar.ðŸ”¥

A lightweight and customizable progress bar for Mojo, meant for tracking the progress of long-running operations in loops.

## Usage

In its simplest use case, you specify the total number of iterations and provide a callback function as parameter that will be called for each iteration:

```python
from time import sleep
from mopro import progress_bar

fn main():
    
    @parameter
    fn one_step(i: Int) -> None:
        sleep(0.01)

    progress_bar[one_step](
        total=256
    )
```

### Terminating the loop

When the callback function returns a `Bool` value, the loop will be terminated when it is `False`.

```python
from time import sleep
from mopro import progress_bar

fn main():

    var stop = 197

    @parameter
    fn one_step(i: Int) -> Bool:
        sleep(0.01)
        return i<stop

    progress_bar[one_step](
        total=256
    )
```

### Customizations

Some basic customization options are availabe right now.

```python
from time import sleep
from mopro import progress_bar

fn main():

    @parameter
    fn one_step(i: Int):
        sleep(0.01)
        
    progress_bar[one_step](
        total=256,
        prefix="Epoch:", 
        bar_size=20,
        bar_fill = "ðŸ”¥",
        bar_empty = "  "
    )
```

## Vectorize Bar

The usage of the Progress Bar is in a way quite similar to Mojo's [vectorize](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional/vectorize) function, making it straightforward to combine the two functionalities. To achieve this, we added the `vectorize_bar` method to our repository.

In the following example, the `vectorized_step` method will be called nine times with a `width` parameter of 16, where the argument `i` increases by 16 with each call. This is followed by 15 additional calls with a `width` parameter of 1, with `i` increasing by 1 each time. The functionality matches that of Mojo's `vectorize` method.

We adjusted the sleep time in `vectorized_step` based on the `width` value to better visualize the process. Since we can update the progress bar only after each call of `vectorized_step`, you will notice jumps in the progress of the bar of 16 steps for the first 9 calls.

```python
from mopro import vectorize_bar

alias simd_width=16

fn main():
    @parameter
    fn vectorized_step[width:Int](i: Int) -> Bool:
        sleep(0.1 * width)
        return True
       
    vectorize_bar[vectorized_step,simd_width](
        total=9*16+15
    )
```


## Remarks

- __Looking for More Advanced Features?__ Check out [Are We Done Yet](https://github.com/Ryul0rd/awdy) for a more advanced progress bar implementation in Mojo. Hillarious name - love it ðŸ”¥
- __Callback as Closure:__ For the sake of flexibility, we decided to define the callback function as closure. If this approach poses any limitations for you, please let us know.
- __Contribute and Improve!__ Feel free to modify and use the source code as you like. If you have enhancements that could benefit others, your pull requests are highly encouraged.
